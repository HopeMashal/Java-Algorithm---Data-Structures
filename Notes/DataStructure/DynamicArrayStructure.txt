# Dynamic Array Structure:-

## Dynamic Array can change the size(length)

# Ex:
Array = [4,8,2,7,9]
Array.add(5) => Array = [4,8,2,7,9,5]

# Array when the number of elements becomes more than the size, the size of the array is multiplied by 2

# Dynamic Array like ArrayList

# For ArrayList in Java:-
## access = Q(1)
## delete = Q(n)
## add = Q(n)
## search = Q(n)
## space = Q(n)
