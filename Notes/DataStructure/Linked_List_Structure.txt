# Linked List Structure:-

## Link List has multiple node connected together and have the address of next node --> We have the address of first node
==> Every Node has value and address of next node
==> next address in last element is NULL

# For Linked List in Java:-
## search = Q(n)
## add = Q(n)
## delete = Q(n)
## space = Q(n)
## access = Q(n)

## Double Link List have the address of next node and the address of previous node
