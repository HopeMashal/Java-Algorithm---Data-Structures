# Hash Table Structure:-

# How to put elements in Hash Table:-
Size = 8
Every index is list
Add 10 --> 10%8 = 2 ==> put it in index 2
Add 26 --> 26%8 = 2 ==> put it in index 2
Add 4 --> 4%8 = 0 ==> put it in index 0
Add 20 --> 20%8 = 4 ==> put it in index 4
==> We have Key and Value in Hash Table

# Access = 6%8 = 6 --> index 6
# Search = O(n)
# insert = O(n)
# Delete = O(n)
