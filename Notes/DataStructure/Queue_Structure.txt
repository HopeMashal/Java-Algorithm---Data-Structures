# Queue Structure:-

## Queue --> First In First Out

## If size == front ==> Queue is full
## Rear at the first elements

## Add element => front +=1
## Delete element => Take element with Rear = 1 ==> Then Rear = 2

## Queue = [2,3,4,5] => Delete [..,3,4,5]
--> Queue[1] --> Rear=2, front=4

# Access = O(n)
# Search = O(n)
# Insert / Add = O(1)
# Delete = O(1)
