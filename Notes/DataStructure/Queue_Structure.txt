# Queue Structure:-

## Queue --> First In First Out

## If size == Rear ==> Queue is full
## Front at the first elements

## Add element => Rear +=1
## Delete element => Take element with Front = 1 ==> Then Front = 2

## Queue = [2,3,4,5] => Delete [..,3,4,5]
--> Queue[1] --> Front=2, Rear=4

# Access = O(n)
# Search = O(n)
# Insert / Add = O(1)
# Delete = O(1)
