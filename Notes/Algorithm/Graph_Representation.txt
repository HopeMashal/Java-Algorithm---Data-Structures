# Graph Representation with Matrix VS Adjacency List:

## Example:

        1
    ____|____
   |         |
   4         6
 __|__       |
|     |      12
8     10

Matrix:
\ | 1 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12
1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0  | 0 
4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1  | 0 
6 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  | 1
8 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0  | 0  
10| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0  | 0  
12| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0  | 0  

1 -- connected to each other
0 -- not connected to each other
