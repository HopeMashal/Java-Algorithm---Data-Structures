# Merge Sort Algorithm :-

## Example:
[1,8,7,4,3,2,5,9] ==> [1,8,7,4] [3,2,5,9] ==> [1,8] [7,4] [3,2] [5,9]
==> [1] [8] [7] [4] [3] [2] [5] [9] ==> [1,8] [4,7] [2,3] [5,9] ==> [1,4,7,8] [2,3,5,9] ==> [1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9]
==> O(n log(n))
O(n log(n)) better than O(n^2)
Merge Sort better than Bubble Sort
